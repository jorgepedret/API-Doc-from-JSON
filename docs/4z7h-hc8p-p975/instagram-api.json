We created it so that you can surface the amazing content Instagram users share every second, in fun and innovative ways.\r\n\r\nBuild something great.\r\n\r\n[Register Your Application](#) then [dive into the documentation](./endpoints)",
  "endpoints_intro": "#Instagram API Endpoints\r\n\r\nOnce you've registered your client it's easy to start requesting data from Instagram.\r\n\r\nAll endpoints are only accessible via https and are located at api.instagram.com. For instance: you can grab the most popular photos at the moment by accessing the following URL with your client ID (replace CLIENT-ID with your own):\r\n\r\n`https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/popular?client_id=CLIENT-ID`\r\n\r\nYou're best off using an access_token for the authenticated user for each endpoint, though many endpoints don't require it. In some cases an access_token will give you more access to information, and in all cases, it means that you are operating under a per-access_token limit vs. the same limit for your single client_id.",
